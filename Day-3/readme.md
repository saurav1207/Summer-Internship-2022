## It's Day-3 :- Added Media Queries to an Existing Technical Documentation Page

### Today, changes are made. In CSS files are as follows:-

- Added CSS Media Queries to make the website response.
- In the media query, I specify a maximum width of 900px.
- When the width is less than 900px, the navbar height is 250px and the width is 100%.Â 
- The navigation bar goes at the top of the page. as well as the main-doc that goes just below the nav.
- Beyond this, some more changes are made to be a fully responsive website.
- My Technical Documentation Page is now fully responsive in all formats.
